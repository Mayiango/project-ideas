## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Infinite Canvas Whiteboard

This project would, essentially, solve the issue of limited zooming when trying to take notes on a touchscreen/stylus based device. Right now, no platform has a great way to take notes that isn't pixel based, meaning when you zoom in you end up with a pixelated image, or if you zoom out you only have tiny controls that are hard to use to take notes. The few vector based drawing apps are hard to find, clunky to use, and aren't created with any specific users in mind.
There are a number of potential end users, and there would be a heavy load of design work upfront. The most obvious use of a fully vector based drawing program would be for diagraming, including scientific diagrams and more complex visualizations, that simply can't be done on the limited canvases most apps currently allow. It could also be very useful for making presentations in a similar manner as Prezi allows, but with less limits on the size of the canvas. Some people may use a social drawing board, where many people can work together on one "white board" of sorts, without running out of room. Finally, it could be useful for someone who wants to organize their notes visually, instead of in separate files. This project would focus on creating a useful and targeted design that would utilize an infinite, vector based canvas.
