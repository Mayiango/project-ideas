## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Stock Sentiment Analysis using Twitter

This project will build a platform for investors to track activity of a particular security or the overall market on social media for e.g., Twitter and use predictive analytics to flag stocks with unusual mentions. Previously, the data used to predict movement in stock prices was mostly objective in nature such as darkpool transactions, put/call ratio and unusual market orders etc. However, the increasing popularity of retail investing and its discussion on social media provides an opportunity to collect data on these platforms, correlate it with the objective metrics and finally flag/predict unusual activities in securities trading by providing the sentiment towards a security in real time.

The goal would be to classify a security in simple terms such as positive, negative or neural. A general Twitter dataset would be used to train the model. The tweets will then need to be processed in a form which is clean and appropriate for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Then, deep learning models (like Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, K-Nearest Neighbors etc.) would need to be used to train the model and find the most suitable model. This model is then used for real time predictions of tweets which are obtained using an API key. The goal is of this project is to provide users with an accurate analysis of subjective and objective information in real time and help identify market opportunities.
