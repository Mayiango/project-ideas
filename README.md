## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Web-scraping and data analysis on the stock market

Web-scraping is a crucial technique during the burst of big data, and handling the skills to make meaningful analyses from this information would help us gain important insights. Out of the vast amount of resources available on the internet, I'm distinctly interested in exploring the mysterious stock market. To achieve that goal, I propose the project to scrape financial stock-related information, such as the open price, bid, ask, volume, total revenue, and the market cap of a company, from credible finance websites. After the scraping algorithm performs well, the later stage of this project aims to perform a rudimentary or intermediate market analysis to recommend as to buy, hold, or sell a given stock. The project may point to various directions of development, such as statistical graphic generations, data analyses, or recommendation systems. 

I believe that this project is large in scale while manageable for students with all levels of expertise in python and web-scraping.  The project is adjustable and encompasses a wide range of possibilities concerning its potentials for developments and usages. From a developer's perspective, the web-scraping algorithm could be used for researching the market's sentiments, the prospects of an industry, or a straightforward graphic display of a stock's statistics. From a user's perspective, the final product might be used for personal interests in studying and investing in the stock market. Furthermore, the project has great potentials to be developed and supported on various technologies, imposing no limitation on computer systems -- such as iOS, Windows, or Linux -- that the developers are using. It doesn't need much extraneous support to work on this project, such as getting a compatible hardware device, borrowing a server, or matching dozens of software' deployment settings.
